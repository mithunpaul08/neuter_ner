{"claim": "ORGANIZATION-c1 Claims an MISC-c1 , PERSON-c1 , Died in Airstrike in", "evidence": "A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of LOCATION-e1 's state broadcaster ORGANIZATION-e1 offers advice to MISC-e1 on how to choose their MISC-e2 names . `` MISC-e2 names come with different connotations . It ' s not always fair to those people , but they do , '' the article warns . `` A name can come with a ` feeling ' or idea about what sort of person you are , and where you come from . '' The adoption of unconventional MISC-e2 names in LOCATION-e1 and other parts of LOCATION-e2 is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats . Any young MISC-e3 who teaches MISC-e2 in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class . NUMBER-e1 friend of WorldViews who taught MISC-e2 and civics in the southern MISC-e1 city of LOCATION-e3 had a number of students whose chosen MISC-e2 names were derived from screen names used during online computer games . There was PERSON-e1 , who was not to be outdone by PERSON-e2 . `` Sure , have fun and pick a random object or word as a name , but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in LOCATION-e4 , '' the post chides . It offers this guide : A good way to work out the ` feeling ' of a name is to watch a bunch of MISC-c1 movies and sitcoms . They ' re full of name stereotypes -- you ' ll find the good girls ' are all ` PERSON-e3 ' s , the jock boys ' are still ` Buds ' and the geeks ' are called ` Sheldon ' . The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of MISC-e2 names typically adopted by MISC-e1 . Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common MISC-e1 family names such as PERSON-e4 or PERSON-e5 . In general , it 's good to avoid food as a name , it suggests . To put bluntly , names like Candy , PERSON-e6 , Sugar -LRB- think anything sweet -RRB- , are typically thought of as ` non-smart girl ' names , or ` stripper ' names . It ' s not always right ; there are doubtless some very smart Candy ' s out there . But it ' s the ORDINAL-e1 thing that comes to mind . Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities . `` Pick any name like PERSON-e7 , PERSON-e8 or PERSON-e9 and you ' re going to get some stares , '' it says . `` You have some pretty big shoes to fill there . '' At a ORGANIZATION-e2 restaurant in LOCATION-e5 , WorldViews DATE-e1 was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read `` PERSON-e10 . '' NUMBER-e1 hopes he did n't harbor similar dreams of power and domination . While it 's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions , it 's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen . Often , MISC-e1 people pick an MISC-e2 name as a play of words based on their original given MISC-e1 name . The LOCATION-e6 offers a few examples from the MISC-e5 city of LOCATION-e5 : Many MISC-e2 names mimic the sound of MISC-e1 given names . A solicitor called PERSON-e11 , for example , has PERSON-e12 as his MISC-e2 name . Singer PERSON-e13 's MISC-e2 name is PERSON-e14 . Another singer , PERSON-e15 , is called PERSON-e16 ... Ho Wai-leuk , a journalist , got his name another way . `` When I was a student , everyone kept saying my MISC-e1 name really fast until it started sounding like ` hoh lok , ' '' he said referring to the MISC-e6 pronunciation for ORGANIZATION-e3 , `` so Cola stuck . '' For most people , our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter . But the practice of adopting a new MISC-e2 name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression , especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway . Who would n't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity ? Just do n't use that power to call yourself `` PERSON-e4 , '' the post says .

The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents , who represented PERCENT-e1 of marijuana possession arrests in the city DATE-e2 , according to the ORGANIZATION-e1 . Advocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on NUMBER-e1 ' s record , but there is a chance that the policy , which LOCATION-e1 is expected to announce DATE-e3 , could boomerang . The strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana -- likely to be defined as NUMBER-e2 grams or less -- to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed , arrested and fingerprinted . But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review , which would identify if a summons was justified in the ORDINAL-e1 place , legal experts say . Under the DATE-e4 system , when an arrest is made , the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor . A prosecutor could throw out the charge or refuse to prosecute should he or she see any indication that the arresting officer violated due process , such as searching a person ' s backpack without probable cause .

'' Another possible repercussion of the city ' s proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates , adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket . Some NUMBER-e5 people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in DATE-e9 ; issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or can not miss work on DATE-e10 of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system . `` It ' s not solving the problem that they ' re trying to solve , '' PERSON-e1 said .

As DATE-e6 as DATE-e7 it looked as if the DATE-e8 of LOCATION-e7 was imminent . The massively outgunned MISC-e8 fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ORGANIZATION-e2 militants advancing into the suburbs , leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre . But with the help of the most intense LOCATION-e8 and MISC-e9 bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far , the MISC-e8 forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over . They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town . News that ORGANIZATION-e2 have been almost entirely forced out of LOCATION-e7 comes after of heavy air strikes by LOCATION-e8 warplanes . ORGANIZATION-e2 ' alleged test flights come despite MISC-e10 and MISC-e9 warplanes carrying out dozens of bombing raids against the group in LOCATION-e1 . The terrorists have regularly used weaponry captured from the MISC-e2 and MISC-e4 armies and have overrun several military bases but this was the ORDINAL-e1 time it had been able to pilot warplanes . ORGANIZATION-e9 accounts had DATE-e4 posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of LOCATION-e1 , but the aircraft had appeared unusable , according to analysts and diplomats . News of the test flights comes as ORGANIZATION-e3 - which has DATE-e4 condemned ORGANIZATION-e2 for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with PERSON-e4 's group . In a statement released DATE-e9 , ORGANIZATION-e3 in the LOCATION-e4 - the notorious terror collective 's MISC-e11 franchise - urged jihadists throughout the LOCATION-e5 to put their differences aside , according to PERSON-e7 , a researcher on jihad at counter-terrorism think-tank PERSON-e8 The document is understood to have called for ORGANIZATION-e3 - who are represented in LOCATION-e1 by the ORGANIZATION-e10 and LOCATION-e9 terror groups - to stop fighting with ORGANIZATION-e2 , adding that the militants should instead focus on attacking MISC-e6 ` crusader ' forces and carrying out strikes on MISC-e10 targets .

The loss of LOCATION-e11 - where MISC-e10 troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the DURATION-e4 war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of LOCATION-e2 's ORDINAL-e2 city of LOCATION-e16 and much of the north .

However rumours had been circulating for DURATION-e3 that several senior figures in the Pakistani ORGANIZATION-e11 were set to declare their loyalty to PERSON-e4 . ' I show allegiance to the commander of faithful , Caliph PERSON-e4 , and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be , ' PERSON-e11 said in the recording . There is DATE-e11 concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani ORGANIZATION-e11 may defect to ORGANIZATION-e2 , including the group 's overall leader PERSON-e15 , who has DATE-e4 voiced support for the terror group . Despite several members having declared their ORGANIZATION-e2 sympathies , the announcement is the ORDINAL-e1 time any senior figure within the ORGANIZATION-e11 has actually sworn allegiance to PERSON-e4 .", "label": "unrelated"}

ORGANIZATION-e3 did not immediately respond to PERSON-e7 's request for comment about the casting report , but PERSON-e3 is no stranger to working with ORGANIZATION-e3 . He DATE-e2 starred in the studio 's This Is DATE-e3 and will star in The Interview in DATE-e4 . This is the ORDINAL-e2 film PERSON-e1 has written , including The ORGANIZATION-e5 in DATE-e5 . It will be told in NUMBER-e1 sequences focusing on ORGANIZATION-e1 's launches of the iPod , NeXT and the MISC-e1 . The movie -- like MISC-e2 ' Jobs flick starring PERSON-e9 as as the titular character and PERSON-e10 as PERSON-e2 did -- will explore Jobs ' life , particularly his relationships . `` It ' s not a biopic ; it ' s not the story of PERSON-e12 -- it ' s something much different than that , '' PERSON-e1 said in DATE-e6 . `` He ' s a fascinating guy -- part hero , part antihero ... He ' s a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people , and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life . '' PERSON-e12 passed away on DATE-e7 . PERSON-e1 confirmed DATE-e8 that he finished the film 's script . `` It will be up to the audience whether it ' s good or not , '' PERSON-e1 said . `` But PERSON-e12 is of the very few times I ended up writing what I set out to write . It ' s an incredibly satisfying feeling . '' PERSON-e2 was critical of PERSON-e10 's portrayal -LRB- `` personalities are very wrong although mine is closer '' -RRB- , so it will be fascinating to see what he has to say about PERSON-e3 . PERSON-e12 introduces the MISC-e1 to the world . Computing would never be the same . PERSON-e14 's famous `` DATE-e9 '' commercial for the original MISC-e1 continues to find imitators , even DATE-e10 . In DATE-e7 , ORGANIZATION-e6 attempted to spoof the classic ad in a promotional spot for its LOCATION-e1 tablet . When PERSON-e15 appeared on-screen at ORGANIZATION-e7 in DATE-e12 , the audience reacted with boos and hisses . Still , the decision to partner with ORGANIZATION-e8 and have ORGANIZATION-e8 commit to producing software for the MISC-e1 was of the most shrewd -- and likely of the most intelligent -- decisions that Jobs made upon his return to ORGANIZATION-e1 . Although many incorrectly believe that ORGANIZATION-e8 `` bought '' Apple in DATE-e12 , the reality is , without ORGANIZATION-e8 's investment and commitment to developing MISC-e1 software , the company may have had a more difficult time getting its next line of products to the market . The iMac helped set the standard for the modern ORGANIZATION-e1 even as we know it DATE-e10 . Designed by PERSON-e16 , the iMac was sleek , modern and affordable . This was not the Macintosh of the early to mid DATE-e13 , it was something new . With the iMac , ORGANIZATION-e1 became cool . We can vividly remember looking at the egg-shaped all-in-one design with the hockey puck mouse and famous lack of a floppy drive and being transfixed . The iMac marked the beginning of Apple NUMBER-e3 . DATE-e14 , ORGANIZATION-e1 debuted the iPod . Famously ridiculed and dismissed by PERSON-e17 , it would be DURATION-e2 before the device would become iconic , and in the process , change ORGANIZATION-e1 fundamentally as a company . The premise behind the iPod was simple : NUMBER-e4 songs in your pocket . Its the execution that set the device apart from everyone else . In DATE-e15 , ORGANIZATION-e1 flipped the switch again , with the launch of the iTunes Music Store . In a MISC-e3 industry , most were skeptical that iTunes could drive music sales . DATE-e16 , iTunes is the number music retailer by a large margin . DURATION-e3 on , the iPod is getting long in the tooth , but it still remains the leader in its product category . After the iPod started to achieve massive success in DATE-e15 and DATE-e17 , the rumors of an iPod phone started to swirl . The ORDINAL-e1 attempt to bring a product like that to the market was in the form of ORGANIZATION-e6 's Rokr . The MISC-e4 tried to capitalize on the success of the MISC-e5 , while also adding compatibility with iTunes . Still , the device was a dud . You can see PERSON-e12 's frustration with the device in this demonstration . The MISC-e4 was an example that only ORGANIZATION-e1 could build an Apple product . PERSON-e12 's commencement speech at ORGANIZATION-e9 in DATE-e18 is of our favorite Jobs moments . It 's riveting , inspirational and every bit as good as any Apple product keynote . All hail the Jesus Phone . The iPhone changed the mobile industry . Full stop . The mobile world and ecosystem that we know DATE-e10 would not exist in the same way that it does DATE-e19 without the iPhone . The iPhone also changed ORGANIZATION-e1 as a company and helped further cement Jobs 's place in history . PERSON-e12 and PERSON-e15 are NUMBER-e5 of the most powerful and influential men of our times . Seeing them together at D5 , just ahead of the iPhone 's LOCATION-e2 launch , was amazing . In DATE-e5 , ORGANIZATION-e1 changed the game again with the iPad . Like the iPod and iPhone , the critics dismissed it and predicted its failure . Its success has outpaced nearly every other technology product launch in history and is having a seismic impact on education , publishing , media consumption and computing in general . The PC era might not be over , but I 'm willing to bet that the computer I use SET-e1 in will have a lot more in common with the iPad than the ORGANIZATION-e10 .", "label": "unrelated"}

The mass abduction occurred at TIME-e1 , and it took DURATION-e2 before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear . Shortly after the abductions , a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by MISC-e1 soldiers , but the remarks turned out to be wrong . Whether or not the MISC-e1 army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned : Its reputation in the rural north is bad , and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes . NUMBER-e3 recent video allegedly showed MISC-e1 soldiers slitting prisoners ' throats , according to ORGANIZATION-e2 . In DURATION-e3 following the mass kidnapping , criticism of the MISC-e1 government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls . In DATE-e7 , PERSON-c1 leader PERSON-e2 released a video message claiming that the girls would `` remain slaves with us .

Only a few NUMBER-e4 girls have managed to escape over DATE-e8 : ORGANIZATION-e3 cited an example of NUMBER-e5 girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for DURATION-e5 through the jungle . Most of the escapes , however , took place shortly after the abductions , as this graph shows . As time passed , hope faded for many parents , and reports of escapes became less frequent . `` The longer they 're there , the greater likelihood they become dispersed , and the more difficult they are to track down , '' PERSON-e3 , director of the ORGANIZATION-e4 at the ORGANIZATION-e5 , told ORGANIZATION-e6 DATE-e3 , before the reports emerged that PERSON-c1 was considering freeing them . There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity -- some say NUMBER-e6 , some say NUMBER-e7 . The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in DATE-e6 . Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since . PERSON-c1 is predominantly active in the northeast of LOCATION-c1 , where the girls were kidnapped , but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country .

Its core area spreads over as much as NUMBER-e10 square kilometers , roughly the size of the LOCATION-e3 . However , PERSON-c1 is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active . Fatalities from non-criminal MISC-e1 violence -- a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors -- have risen rapidly since DATE-e12 , and PERSON-c1 attacks are the main driver behind this rise . The militant group has killed at least NUMBER-e11 DATE-e2 , according to estimates of the ORGANIZATION-e7 . This graph shows how fatalities caused by PERSON-c1 went up from around NUMBER-e12 to more than NUMBER-e13 within only DURATION-e7 . Although the threat posed by PERSON-c1 had grown steadily , it took until the DATE-e6 abductions for the conflict to make international headlines . The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to PERSON-c1 on social media . Up until DATE-e7 , about NUMBER-e14 tweets were posted , using the hashtag # BringBackOurGirls . According to the ORGANIZATION-e8 , most people who used the hashtag lived in LOCATION-c1 -LRB- PERCENT-e1 -RRB- and the LOCATION-e4 -LRB- PERCENT-e2 -RRB- . Still , thousands of tweets are being posted SET-e1 in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the MISC-e1 schoolgirls .

It 's time to # BringBackOurGirls . '' Our prayers are with the missing MISC-e1 girls and their families . It 's time to MONEY-e1 . - DURATION-e8 pic.twitter.com/glDKDotJRt -- The ORDINAL-e1 Lady -LRB- @ FLOTUS -RRB- DATE-e7 The PERSON-e4 administration deployed NUMBER-e16 military personnel to LOCATION-e5 in DATE-e7 . In a letter , the ORGANIZATION-e9 said : `` These personnel will support the operation of intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern LOCATION-c1 and the surrounding area , '' and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls . LOCATION-e5 is east of LOCATION-c1 . Other countries , such as LOCATION-e6 , LOCATION-e7 and LOCATION-e8 , have also sent military assistance to the region . According to some reports , PERSON-c1 started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in DATE-e7 . The value of a girl , according to PERSON-c1 : MONEY-e2 . The ORGANIZATION-e10 cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions . In a video message , PERSON-c1 leader PERSON-e2 had reportedly announced : `` I abducted your girls . I will sell them in the market , by Allah . '' The hunt for PERSON-c1 leader PERSON-e2 had started well before the mass abductions of the girls . In DATE-e17 , the ORGANIZATION-e11 added PERSON-e2 to its `` Rewards for Justice Program , '' offering up to MONEY-e3 for information that led to his capture . Those efforts have been unsuccessful . A video which was released DATE-e18 showed PERSON-e2 alive and in freedom . Meanwhile , ORGANIZATION-e12 -- the international development agency of the LOCATION-e4 -- has devoted about MONEY-e4 to programs aimed at providing education to MISC-e1 children and teenagers . The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in LOCATION-c1 . Only PERCENT-e3 of primary-age children have ever attended school in LOCATION-e9 , the state in which the kidnappings took place .

The MISC-e2 , however , don ' t seem to be enamored by the presence of the ORDINAL-e1 Lady in their country .

Also pertinent to note was the fact that PERSON-e1 did not wear a head scarf during the time she was out in public . As per law , all women in the country , even visitors , are required by law to wear a head scarf while in public . This is perhaps why the state TV blurred the ORDINAL-e1 Lady out entirely . There is also talk about the new King insulting PERSON-e6 by breaking protocol . The new King apparently abruptly turned around and walked away from the President in order to go for a prayer . This , however , could have been due to the inexperience of the new King , others allege . Later in DATE-e5 , the King held bilateral talks with other senior staff , including Secretary of State PERSON-e9 , Senator PERSON-e10 , National Security Adviser PERSON-e11 , Ambassador PERSON-e12 , and ORGANIZATION-e7 director PERSON-e13 .

'' In terms of the potential new addition to the LOCATION-e3 chain , ORGANIZATION-e1 claims that the other reason why LOCATION-e1 might single out LOCATION-e2 is that they want to make nice with some MISC-e2 countries in hopes of improving diplomacy and their global image . North Korean Leadership Watch editor PERSON-e7 tells the Mail that PERSON-e1 has been trying to think of ways to buddy up with LOCATION-e2 ever since its bid for sovereignty , and has more hope for acceptance there than in those other judgy MISC-e2 countries like LOCATION-e10 and LOCATION-e11 . PERSON-e7 also claims that tourists in LOCATION-e1 are already encouraged to pay tips in Scotch rather than won -LRB- the local currency -RRB- . PERSON-e9 of the ORGANIZATION-e4 is also quoted as arguing , `` LOCATION-e1 is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy , as LOCATION-e1 itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation . '' In this case , that may mean trying to snuggle up with a LOCATION-e3 franchise that will attempt to win over the Scots via dishes such as barbecued cuttlefish , kimchi , pine-nut gruel , dog meat soup , and a mysterious aphrodisiac made out of bears . -LRB- Although these foods are served at other LOCATION-e3 restaurants , there is no specific evidence that they ' d make their way onto menus in LOCATION-e2 -RRB- . There has been no official announcement from LOCATION-e1 confirming that they are opening a restaurant in LOCATION-e2 -- in fact , a MISC-e1 embassy official DATE-e2 denied the story to The Independent . But as it is with many other wealth-generating businesses in LOCATION-e1 , many critics believe that cash flow from the restaurant chain goes straight to MISC-e4 himself and his small group of elites with virtually no trickle-down to the MISC-e1 people . PERSON-e1 , NUMBER-e2 , gained quite a bit of attention for his diagnosis of gout , a disease commonly caused by overindulgence in rich , fatty foods . It was widely reported that he became ill and developed a limp and facial swelling because he had become literally addicted to Emmental , more commonly called `` MISC-e5 cheese . '' No other details about the new restaurant have yet to be verified , so it ' s unclear whether tipping in whisky would be encouraged .", "label": "unrelated"}

The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into PERSON-e1 ' s death . It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident . They said PERSON-e1 , who was black , and PERSON-e4 , who is white , were seen struggling through the driver ' s side window of PERSON-e4 ' s police car .

{"claim": "MISC-c1 To Play Steve Jobs In ORGANIZATION-c1 's Next Biopic", "evidence": "PERSON-e1 for ORGANIZATION-e1 data LOCATION-e1 -- The ORGANIZATION-e2 will no longer arrest people for low-level marijuana possession , according to people with knowledge of the city ' s drug strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity . The NYPD will issue violation summonses to people caught with marijuana -- instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a precinct . The summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine . Few details on the new policy were immediately available , but an official with NUMBER-e1 of the city ' s NUMBER-e2 district attorneys offices confirmed to MISC-e1 on DATE-e1 that the change `` is happening . '' The official added that `` burning marijuana '' would still be cause for arrest , but that having the drug in a public place would not . The NYPD and Mayor PERSON-e2 ' s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment , but are expected to officially announce the new policy at a news conference on DATE-e1 . LOCATION-e2 District Attorney PERSON-e3 said DATE-e1 he supported the change DATE-e2 and still does . `` This policy -- by diverting thousands of cases from criminal court -- will also keep low-level offenders , particularly teens , from an arrest and all its attendant consequences , including a TIME-e1 or more in jail , '' he said . The new policy , which was ORDINAL-e1 reported by the ORGANIZATION-e3 , would bring about a sea change in the way the city is policed . Misdemeanor-level marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the city ' s arrests , a vast majority of which happen to young black or MISC-e2 men living in poor neighborhoods . Some public defenders praised the policy . `` This is a huge improvement , '' PERSON-e4 , executive director of ORGANIZATION-e4 , told . `` Summonses don ' t get you fingerprinted . This will be better for people who are vulnerable to collateral consequences , like immigrants . '' Still , PERSON-e4 cautioned that the policy will not fulfill its goal unless the NYPD relaxes its identification requirements for summonses . Immigrants and teenagers often do not carry valid identification , she said , which often means that they can not be processed for a summons . She added that the policy does not address the root cause of the problem -- namely , that police officers in routinely stop people without probable cause . `` Having summonses is an improvement for people who are already being stopped , but that doesn ' t mean they should be stopped in the ORDINAL-e1 place , '' she said . `` The problem , from my perspective , is that stopping people without cause is unconstitutional . '' Advocates also warned that the new policy could result in an increased number of arrest warrants , which are issued to people who fail to show to court for a summons . As the ORGANIZATION-e3 reported , DURATION-e1 of people issued summons fail to appear for their court appointments . As a consequence , there are DATE-e3 NUMBER-e3 open bench warrants in LOCATION-e4 -- about NUMBER-e1 per every NUMBER-e4 residents . Possession of less than NUMBER-e5 grams of marijuana has not been a crime in LOCATION-e5 since DATE-e4 . The NYPD made NUMBER-e6 arrests for misdemeanor possession in DATE-e5 . Under DATE-e6 law , the only way to get arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for having less than NUMBER-e5 grams of marijuana is to display it `` in public view . '' The legal definition of that term , however , is ambiguous . `` Public view '' can mean smoking pot in a public place , but it can also mean that a police officer stopped you , frisked you , and pulled a small bag of marijuana from your pocket . When the bag leaves your pocket , it has technically entered public view , and the officer can legally arrest you and charge you with a misdemeanor -- even though you had less than the decriminalized amount . This broad interpretation of `` public view '' helped low-level marijuana possession become NUMBER-e1 of the NYPD ' s most commonly used arrest charges during stop-and-frisks . The correlation between marijuana arrests and stop-and-frisk became apparent after DATE-e7 , when a ORGANIZATION-e5 declared the policing tactic an unconstitutional form of racial profiling . By DATE-e8 , the NYPD was making only NUMBER-e7 marijuana possession arrests -- still a large number , but PERCENT-e1 less than in DATE-e5 . A recent study by the nonprofit ORGANIZATION-e1 found that upwards of PERCENT-e2 of all low-level marijuana arrests made in DATE-e9 affected black people or MISC-e3 -- even though national studies have shown that white people are just as likely to smoke marijuana regularly , and slightly more likely to have tried it . The report also found that the geography of the arrests is highly segregated , with dominantly white neighborhoods seeing fewer arrests than neighborhoods of color with similar per-capita incomes . These stark race and class disparities in drug law enforcement became a sore point for Mayor PERSON-e2 , who as a candidate promised to end discriminatory policing . They also drove PERSON-e7 , the district attorney , to announce in DATE-e10 that his office would no longer prosecute low-level marijuana possession , opting instead to dismiss most of such cases . Still , the NYPD defended the high number of arrests , with PERSON-e8 , PERSON-e2 ' s police commissioner , saying that PERSON-e7 ' s decision would not affect the NYPD ' s approach to marijuana possession . The policy to be announced on DATE-e1 will mark the ORDINAL-e1 time the DATE-e6 administration will take concerted action to address the disparities in marijuana arrests . In an interview with the ORGANIZATION-e3 , PERSON-e7 said he was worried that the new policy could harm those it was intended to help by removing prosecutors from the picture . This is because a prosecutor can opt to dismiss a misdemeanor , but can not do the same for a violation . But as new report by the ORGANIZATION-e7 shows , prosecutorial review can cut both ways . The ORGANIZATION-e7 analyzed data provided by the LOCATION-e2 District Attorney and found that black people and MISC-e3 were `` much more likely to receive a sentence offer including a jail of prison term '' than white defendants in similar circumstances . In the case of misdemeanor marijuana possession , the Vera report found , black people arraigned in LOCATION-e2 were PERCENT-e3 more likely to receive jail or prison time than people from all other ethnicities . By contrast , defendants arrested in could expect their cases to be dismissed . The new policy is expected to standardize procedures across the city . More details on the new policy are expected soon . PERSON-e10 and PERSON-e8 are scheduled to make an announcement together DATE-e1 TIME-e2 . This is a developing story .

' I could wait all DURATION-e6 for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear , or I could just make it disappear myself , ' NUMBER-e17 ex-soldier told ORGANIZATION-e22 .

{"claim": "Hundreds of MISC-c1 flee as LOCATION-c1 opens dams into", "evidence": "The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering , but it ' s also updated the famous adage that `` there ' s a sucker born SET-e1 '' for the MISC-e1 age . And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the MISC-e2 conflict . Not only will people believe anything about LOCATION-c1 ; their editors will let them write it . And as we learned DATE-e1 , pretty much SET-e2 someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the `` flood libel . '' There are moments when biased coverage of LOCATION-c1 goes beyond mere opinion . DATE-e2 , the good folks at ORGANIZATION-e1 , a notoriously error-ridden site , declared the existence of a bridge connecting the LOCATION-e2 and LOCATION-e3 . It was not a maddening mistake ; it was , rather , kind of endearing . It was adorable , in its own way . But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact . Same goes for ORGANIZATION-e2 bureau chief PERSON-e1 ' s claim in DATE-e3 that prospective MISC-e3 construction in the LOCATION-e2 would bisect the LOCATION-e2 and make physical contiguity impossible . As was subsequently pointed out -LRB- and corrected accordingly -RRB- , this was not even close to being true and PERSON-e1 would have known as much had she glanced at a map . And DATE-e4 we were treated to another version of this story , though it ' s NUMBER-e1 we hear often enough . It ' s a bit of a hazing ritual : the MISC-c1 find someone they haven ' t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold . The lie is this : that flooding in LOCATION-e3 was caused by LOCATION-c1 opening dams in the LOCATION-e4 . Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams . They are the LOCATION-e5 bridge of this story . And yet , the story just keeps appearing because the MISC-c1 never run out of MISC-e5 suckers . NUMBER-e2 of the suckers DATE-e5 was Vice News . To try to hide its ignorance , Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the MISC-c1 followed by this attempt at `` balance '' : `` MISC-e6 officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to MISC-e7 on DATE-e6 . '' Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel . As HonestReporting notes , the SET-e3 Mail went with a bit of false balance but also , crucially , added a straight correction and admission of error : `` An earlier version of this article stated that LOCATION-c1 had opened river dams in the south of the country , causing flooding in the LOCATION-e3 strip . In fact , there are no dams in southern LOCATION-c1 and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues . We are happy to clarify this . '' According to HonestReporting , the piece also contained the following amazing sentence : `` The flooding was DATE-e7 compounded after an MISC-e6 power company cut electricity to NUMBER-e3 of LOCATION-e3 ' s major LOCATION-e2 cities . '' And according to CAMERA , both ORGANIZATION-e4 and ORGANIZATION-e5 -LRB- shocking , I know -RRB- passed along the flood libel . ORGANIZATION-e6 pulled its video , and ORGANIZATION-e5 went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute . The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others ' mistakes . See this post from PERSON-e3 in DATE-e8 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising . ORGANIZATION-e7 spokeswoman PERSON-e4 understandably would rather news organizations ORDINAL-e1 locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor ' s ox : So why does this keep happening ? Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness . The MISC-e1 has put so much information within arm ' s reach , and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to LOCATION-c1 , the facts are optional . And that ' s because the facts favor LOCATION-c1 . If you were to draw a map of LOCATION-c1 , using MISC-e5 news organizations ' reporting , you ' d have NUMBER-e1 that showed LOCATION-c1 bisecting the LOCATION-e2 while connecting it to LOCATION-e3 via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of LOCATION-e6 . None of that is true , but that ' s the picture that emerges from the media ' s `` reporting . '' There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work . These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by MISC-e8 propaganda . But they also seem not to mind , because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them . If what I ' m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist , not a journalist , well -- that ' s about right . And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the MISC-e9 mill . The ORDINAL-e1 headline is the NUMBER-e1 that makes waves , especially in the MISC-e10 world and in LOCATION-e7 . If the follow-up is not a full retraction or correction , but rather a `` balanced '' piece in which LOCATION-c1 is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don ' t exist , then it casts the MISC-e6 government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover-up . It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can ' t get the story right . But that ' s na\u00efve . The truth is , much of the time our media just won ' t get it right .

LOCATION-e1 's state media , which usually chronicles PERSON-e1 's whereabouts in great detail , has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on DATE-e2 . The source said that PERSON-e1 hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises . `` He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too . They were crawling and running and rolling around , and he pulled a tendon , '' the source told ORGANIZATION-e1 on condition of anonymity . `` He injured his ankle and knee around DATE-e3 or DATE-e4 while drilling because he is overweight .

PERSON-e1 needs DURATION-e2 to recuperate , said the source , whose information could not be independently verified . `` PERSON-e1 is in total control , '' said the source , who has close ties to LOCATION-e2 and LOCATION-e3 .

The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents , who represented PERCENT-e1 of marijuana possession arrests in the city DATE-e2 , according to the ORGANIZATION-e1 . Advocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on NUMBER-e1 ' s record , but there is a chance that the policy , which LOCATION-e1 is expected to announce DATE-e3 , could boomerang . The strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana -- likely to be defined as NUMBER-e2 grams or less -- to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed , arrested and fingerprinted . But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review , which would identify if a summons was justified in the ORDINAL-e1 place , legal experts say . Under the DATE-e4 system , when an arrest is made , the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor .

The ' s office has dismissed NUMBER-e3 misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of NUMBER-e4 such cases since DATE-e7 , according to the ORGANIZATION-e5 .

'' Another possible repercussion of the city ' s proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates , adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket . Some NUMBER-e5 people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in DATE-e9 ; issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or can not miss work on DATE-e10 of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system . `` It ' s not solving the problem that they ' re trying to solve , '' PERSON-e1 said .

As of TIME-e1 , the ORGANIZATION-e1 was investigating ; between the guy ' s IP and the fact that the video file is presumably timestamped , I assume they ' ll be able to verify or debunk it quickly .

If you were going to prank ORGANIZATION-c1 by getting them to air something sexually explicit in the name of reporting news , you ' d be more explicit than this , no ? If it ' s authentic , it tells us how many shots were fired . The man ' s attorney tells PERSON-e1 she hears NUMBER-e1 shots . I hear NUMBER-e2 . A forensic examiner who listened to the tape told ORGANIZATION-c1 he heard `` at least NUMBER-e2 , '' NUMBER-e3 shots followed by a pause followed by NUMBER-e4 more . The autopsy report from the family ' s forensic pathologist claims PERSON-c1 was hit at least NUMBER-e3 times , all from the front . That means that he was hit at least twice in the ORDINAL-e1 flurry of NUMBER-e3 shots heard here , and furthermore that he was facing PERSON-e3 at some point during that flurry . It ' s bizarre to me that PERSON-c1 would have turned back to face a man who was still in the process of firing at him at fairly close range , but I don ' t know what other conclusion can be drawn based on what we know . The fact that PERSON-c1 had apparently been wounded before the fateful pause , during which he either rushed PERSON-e3 or tried to surrender , is also important . The prosecution will argue that PERSON-e3 , having already drawn blood , should have realized that a weakened PERSON-c1 was no longer as much of a physical threat . PERSON-e3 will argue that he felt threatened precisely because PERSON-c1 allegedly kept coming after he was wounded . A man strong enough to take NUMBER-e5 shots and angry enough about it to advance on a cop with a gun was lethally dangerous , he ' ll say . Here ' s how PERSON-c1 ' s friend , PERSON-e4 , described what happened to them : DATE-e1 , in line with the officer ' s driver ' s side door , they could see the officer ' s face . They heard him say something to the effect of , `` what ' d you say ? '' At the same time , PERSON-e4 says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into PERSON-c1 and bounced closed . PERSON-e4 says the officer , with his left hand , grabbed PERSON-c1 by the neck ... At that moment , PERSON-e4 says he fixed his gaze on the officer to see if he was pulling a stun gun or a real gun . That ' s when he saw the muzzle of the officer ' s gun . `` I seen the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend , '' he said . `` He had it pointed at him and said ` I ' ll shoot , ' NUMBER-e6 more time . '' DATE-e2 PERSON-e6 said he heard the ORDINAL-e1 shot go off ... PERSON-e4 says he was within arm ' s reach of both PERSON-c1 and the officer . He looked over at PERSON-c1 and saw blood pooling through his shirt on the right side of the body . `` The whole time -LSB- the officer -RSB- was holding my friend until the gun went off , '' PERSON-e4 noted . PERSON-c1 and PERSON-e4 took off running together . There were NUMBER-e7 cars lined up along the side of the street . PERSON-e4 says he ducked behind the ORDINAL-e1 car , whose NUMBER-e5 passengers were screaming . Crouching down a bit , he watched PERSON-c1 run DATE-e3 . `` Keep running , bro ! , '' he said PERSON-c1 yelled . Then PERSON-c1 yelled it DURATION-e1 time .

'' the officer took his shot , striking PERSON-c1 in the back . At that point , PERSON-e4 says PERSON-c1 stopped , turned with his hands up and said `` I don ' t have a gun , stop shooting ! '' According to PERSON-e4 , then , the ORDINAL-e1 shot to hit PERSON-c1 was fired while PERSON-e3 was still sitting in the squad car struggling with him , which at least would explain how PERSON-c1 was hit from the front during the ORDINAL-e1 flurry . PERSON-c1 then managed to run NUMBER-e7 car lengths before PERSON-e3 -- presumably still inside the car -- fired his shot , hitting PERSON-c1 in the back . We know from the autopsy report that the last detail is false ; after listening to this audio , the timeline on the ORDINAL-e1 part seems false too . There ' s virtually no delay between the ORDINAL-e1 shots fired , certainly not long enough for words to be exchanged between PERSON-c1 and PERSON-e4 . Unless the audio here picks up after the ORDINAL-e1 shot was fired , i.e . unless it begins with what ' s actually the shot fired at PERSON-c1 , I don ' t know how to square PERSON-e4 ' s account with this . Here ' s what the ORGANIZATION-e3 said about what eyewitnesses have told police : Some of the accounts seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially unfolded : with a struggle between the officer , PERSON-e3 , and the teenager , PERSON-c1 . Officer PERSON-e3 was inside his patrol car at the time , while Mr. PERSON-c1 , who was unarmed , was leaning in through an open window . Many witnesses also agreed on what happened next : Officer PERSON-e3 ' s firearm went off inside the car , Mr. PERSON-c1 ran away , the officer got out of his car and began firing toward Mr. PERSON-c1 , and then Mr. PERSON-c1 stopped , turned around and faced the officer . That seems more likely than PERSON-e3 squeezing off a bunch of rounds while still inside his car . But in that case , since there must have been a delay of DURATION-e1 or NUMBER-e5 between the ORDINAL-e1 shot that went off inside the car , PERSON-e3 getting out of the car , taking aim at PERSON-c1 , and then firing again , where ' s that delay on the audio ? The ORDINAL-e1 shots are basically continuous . Exit question : Can anything be discerned from the length of the pause between flurries ? PERSON-e4 says PERSON-c1 put his hands up and tried to surrender , saying , `` I don ' t have a gun , stop shooting ! '' PERSON-e3 ' s alleged friend , PERSON-e10 , told PERSON-e11 that PERSON-c1 taunted PERSON-e3 and then rushed him .

{"claim": "PERSON-c1 Wants PERSON-c2 Fired Over LOCATION-c1 Helicopter Story : Report", "evidence": "The LOCATION-e1 appears to DATE-e1 be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of LOCATION-e2 , LOCATION-e3 . The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the Predator . The NUMBER-e1 photos show the distinct downward facing MISC-e1 tail used on Predator drones , and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles . As such , the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes , rather than in a hunter-killer type mission . According to local activists , the drone has been circling over the city for DURATION-e1 . If the reports are true , this would suggest that the air environment over LOCATION-e2 is permissive . Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems . The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery -- and possibly signals intelligence -LRB- SIGINT -RRB- -- of ORGANIZATION-e1 positions in the group ' s most important stronghold . There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give LOCATION-e4 policymakers more information about IS positions in LOCATION-e2 . However , it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in LOCATION-e3 . As of DATE-e1 , there is no information about where the drones are based . However , open-source information allows for some informed guesses . The LOCATION-e1 DATE-e2 bases Predator drones in LOCATION-e5 at LOCATION-e6 . The drones are routinely flown over LOCATION-c1 and data is shared in real time with the MISC-e2 military . DURATION-e2 option could be that the drones are being flown from LOCATION-e8 . Satellite imagery captured the deployment of LOCATION-e4 drones at LOCATION-e9 . A ORDINAL-e1 option is that the LOCATION-e1 is DATE-e1 flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi LOCATION-e10 .

Unfortunately for ORGANIZATION-e1 , things are n't looking much better , as MacRumors reports on a particularly nasty iOS NUMBER-c1 bug , which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive . According to the report , the option to `` Reset All Settings , '' found under Settings -- General -- Reset in iOS NUMBER-c1 , also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive -- permanently . The option , which normally resets settings to factory defaults , clearly states that `` no data or media will be deleted . '' However , after some users on MacRumors ' forum complained about the bug , MacRumors tested the option out , and indeed , all the iWork documents stored in LOCATION-e1 both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone . Even worse , after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite , the documents were deleted from the Mac as well . Some of the documents -- including Preview and TextEdit files -- were untouched , but all iWork files seem to be affected . In some scenarios it 's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder , or via ORGANIZATION-e2 , but nothing is certain at this point , and ORGANIZATION-e1 still has n't publicly acknowledged the bug .
